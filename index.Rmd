# Introduction

The [https://www.netlifycms.org](NetlifyCMS) looks really cool. Hope this works!

# Goal

Ideally, we'll end up with a page that is editable by non-git users via Netlify's point-and-click interface.

# Code

Here's some random `R` code in a block.

```
library(dplyr)

starwars %>% 
  filter(species == "Droid")
```
# New from Netlify

Hi!!!
